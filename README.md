ML course practice with dataset "Credit Card customers". Trying to predict credit_limit using regression models.
The Classic Model in Machine Learning using Python and Scikit-Learn project with the specific dataset from a bank aims to predict the credit limit for their customers. In this project, we try to work with popular algorithms such as linear regression, decision trees, random forests.

The project aims to provide hands-on experience in working with a real-world dataset and implementing traditional machine learning models using Python and Scikit-Learn. The first step is to preprocess and clean the data by handling missing values, outliers, and other data quality issues. Afterward, explore the dataset to extract useful features for predicting the credit limit.

The project will focus on feature engineering, model selection, and hyperparameter tuning. In this project we split the dataset into training and testing sets and implement various regression models using Scikit-Learn. They will use the training set to train the models and evaluate their performance on the testing set. The project will emphasize the importance of hyperparameter tuning to ensure that the models achieve the best possible performance.
